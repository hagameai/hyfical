# Git Operations

## Overview

This project provides a set of basic Git operations encapsulated within a Python class. The main functionalities are implemented in multiple files to ensure modularity and maintainability.

## File Structure

- **git_operations_f1j9.py**: Contains the `GitOperations` class for basic Git functions.
- **git_operations.py**: Another implementation of the `GitOperations` class, possibly with variations.
- **git_operations_9cwl.py**: Yet another version of the `GitOperations` class implementation.
- **test_git_operations_mt51.py**: Unit tests for the Git operations using the unittest framework.
- **test_git_operations_zpuz.py**: Another set of unit tests for the Git operations.

## Setup

Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the GitOperations class, import it in your Python script:

```python
from git_operations import GitOperations
```

Then, create an instance of the class and call its methods:

```python
git_ops = GitOperations()
# Call methods like git_ops.clone(), git_ops.commit(), etc.
```

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests, execute:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s . -p "test_*.py"
```
