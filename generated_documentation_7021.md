# Project Documentation

## Overview
This project provides a set of Python classes and unit tests for basic Git operations, encapsulated in a `GitOperations` class. The project consists of 46 files with a total of 2751 lines of code.

## File Structure
- **Python Files (.py)**: 29 files containing the main logic and functionality.
- **Markdown Files (.md)**: 17 files for documentation and guides.

## GitOperations Class
The `GitOperations` class encapsulates methods to perform various Git operations.

### Methods

#### `initialize_repository(repo_name)`
Initializes a new Git repository in the specified directory.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `repo_name` (str): Name of the repository to be created.
- **Returns**: 
  - `bool`: True if the repository was initialized successfully, False otherwise.

#### `add_file(repo_name, file_name, content)`
Adds a file to the specified Git repository with the given content.

- **Parameters**: 
  - `repo_name` (str): The name of the repository.
  - `file_name` (str): The name of the file to be added.
  - `content` (str): The content to be written in the file.

### Error Handling
Exceptions are caught and printed, providing feedback on any issues encountered during the operations.

## Testing
The project includes unit tests for the `GitOperations` class using the `unittest` framework.

### Test Class: `TestGitOperations`
- **setUp()**: Creates a temporary directory for testing.
- **tearDown()**: Cleans up the test directory after tests.

#### Test Methods
- `test_initialize_repository`: Validates successful initialization of a Git repository.
- `test_initialize_existing_repository`: Ensures that trying to initialize an existing repository returns the correct response.

## Usage
To use the `GitOperations` class, import it into your Python script and call the desired methods. Ensure that Git is installed and accessible in your environment.

## Conclusion
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the project, detailing the functionality and usage of the `GitOperations` class along with its testing framework.
